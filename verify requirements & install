I tried following the installation instructions on neon's official site:
http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html

sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install h5py
sudo pip install pyaml
sudo pip install virtualenv

make sure cuda is in the PATH
if you followed my tutorial on installing ubuntu with GTX1080 its already there
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:"$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/local/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

had an issue with ippicv that was resolved with:
sudo cp ~/opencv/3rdparty/ippicv/unpack/ippicv/lib/intel64/libippicv.a /usr/local/lib/

assuming you followed my previous tutorial on installing ubuntu with GTX1080 its already there the following will be needed:
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
select 0 for automatic
sudo update-alternatives --config g++
select 0 for automatic

git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git
cd neon
make               # to install to virtual environment or 
make sysinstall    # to install without virtual environment
