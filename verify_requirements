I tried following the installation instructions on neon's official site:
http://neon.nervanasys.com/docs/latest/installation.html

sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install h5py
sudo pip install pyaml
sudo pip install virtualenv

make sure cuda is in the PATH
if you followed my tutorial on installing ubuntu with GTX1080 its already there
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:"$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/local/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
